# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset - Machine Learning Models

This repository contains two machine learning models for the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. The models are built using different algorithms to classify tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)). It contains 569 instances with 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

## Models
1. **Random Forest Classifier** :
   - A Random Forest model trained on the dataset.
   - Achieves high accuracy in classifying tumors.

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** :
   - An SVM model trained on the same dataset.
   - Provides an alternative approach to classification.


## Requirements
To run the models, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
